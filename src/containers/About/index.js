                    <p>Twelve Gauge Records is an independent record label currently operating out of New York, NY with a rich roster of hardcore and metal artists like Sabertooth Zombie, Power, Heavy Heavy Low Low, and others.</p>

                    <p>The label was founded in 2004 with it's first release, Courtside Seats EP by Heavy Heavy Low Low, out in early 2005. Since then, over 20 artists put together a discography of over 30 releases mostly pressed on vinyl only.</p>

                    <p>No two releases will sound alike as no effort is put into following a specific template or routine. This is a DIY effort with a strong passion for the music and the scene.</p>
